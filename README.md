# AO3 Web Wrapper (Unofficial, Fan-Made App)

A lightweight, ad-free Android app that loads the official Archive of Our Own (AO3) website inside a simple WebView interface.  
This project is **unofficial**, **fan-made**, and **not affiliated with AO3 or OTW** in any way.

## About the Project

I originally created this app **for my own personal use** because I prefer accessing AO3 through a dedicated app rather than a mobile browser.  
All the AO3-related apps I found on the Play Store were filled with ads or unnecessary monetization, which made the experience frustrating.  
So I built a clean, ad-free alternative for myself, and I’m open-sourcing it in case others find it helpful.

## What the App Does

- Loads the **official AO3 website** directly through a WebView  
- Keeps all AO3 features intact (login, browsing, tags, filters, bookmarks, etc.)  
- Provides a smoother "app-like" experience on mobile  
- Stays minimal and fast  
- No custom UI — just AO3 as it is


This app is literally **a wrapper of AO3**, nothing more.
