# AO3-WebWrapper
This is a simple web-wrapper Android application for Archive of Our Own (AO3). It loads the official AO3 website inside an app interface for easier mobile use. There are no ads, no monetization, no tracking, and no modifications to AO3 content.
This project is unofficial and not affiliated with AO3 or OTW.

I originally made this app for my own personal use.
I prefer using an app instead of the browser, but every AO3-related app I found on the Play Store was filled with ads so I built a clean, ad-free version for myself.
